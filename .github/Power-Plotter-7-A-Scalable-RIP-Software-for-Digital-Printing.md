- **Powerful color management:** Power Plotter 7 has an integrated color management system (CMS) that allows you to use different ICC profiles for each element on the work table and different "color spaces" within the same file. You can also test your profiles (soft proofing) with a preview of the image "in double", with only the reference profile and with the print profile for immediate verification of color fidelity.
- **Professional calibration system:** Power Plotter 7 has a multichannel linearization module that optimizes the use of all the inks of your printer. You can also choose the number of inks to use in printing (CMYK - CMYKcm - CMYKcmk...) to optimize quality and consumption. Power Plotter 7 also has an integrated black generation system.
- **Color correction curves (output curves):** Power Plotter 7 allows you to perform color correction directly in printing using curves and sliders with instant preview.
- **Optional modules:** You can enhance Power Plotter 7 with optional modules such as Server Module, which allows you to manage up to 30 queues (printers) and 30 Hot Folders simultaneously, and PowerProfiler, which is an advanced proprietary color management module that allows you to create COLOR PROFILES and DEVICE-LINK that guarantee a higher quality of color reproduction than external profilers from third parties.
