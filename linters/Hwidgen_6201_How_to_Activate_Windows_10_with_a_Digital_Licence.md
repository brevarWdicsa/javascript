In this article, we will show you how to use Hwidgen 62.01 to activate Windows 10 with a digital licence in a few simple steps.
 
## What is Hwidgen 62.01?
 
Hwidgen 62.01 is a small tool that can activate Windows 10 (including VL editions) with a permanent digital licence. It works by exploiting a vulnerability that Microsoft left in the Windows 10 installer, which allows it to generate a HWID based on your hardware and register it on the Microsoft servers.
 
Once you have a HWID digital licence, you don't need to run this tool again and you can reinstall Windows 10 as many times as you want on the same hardware. The Microsoft servers will recognize your HWID and grant you activation automatically. However, if you change your hardware or install a different edition of Windows 10, you may need to run this tool again or use a generic key to regain activation.
 
Hwidgen 62.01 does not install or store any files for activation in your system, so you don't need to worry about antivirus or firewall issues. You just need to have an internet connection while using this tool to get activation instantly, but it also works offline with an error at the end. The next time you go online, the system will activate.
 
## How to use Hwidgen 62.01?
 
Using Hwidgen 62.01 is very easy and straightforward. Just follow these steps:
 
1. Download Hwidgen 62.01 from one of these links: [^1^] [^2^]. Extract the zip file and run hwid.exe as administrator.
2. Select the work mode: HWID for normal activation or KMS38 for LTSC 2019 and Server editions.
3. Click on Start and wait for the tool to generate your HWID and activate Windows 10.
4. Restart your computer and enjoy your activated Windows 10 with a digital licence.

If you encounter any problems with activation, you can check the following things:

- Make sure your internet is working fine and you are not using any VPN.
- Make sure there is no windows update blocker program or antispyware tool interfering with the activation.
- Make sure there are no entries in your hosts file or firewall blocking the Microsoft servers.
- If you have installed a VL edition of Windows 10, you may need to enter its generic key or use the key-install option in this tool.
- If you have installed Windows 10 version 1507, you need to upgrade to a newer version as this tool does not support it.
- If none of these solutions work, you can post your concern here with the hwidgen generated log file for further assistance.

## Conclusion
 
Hwidgen 62.01 is a handy tool that can activate Windows 10 with a permanent digital licence without using any product key or KMS server. It is simple, fast and safe to use. You just need to run it once and forget about activation issues forever. However, if you want to support Microsoft and get official updates and features, you should buy a genuine licence from their website or authorized resellers.
